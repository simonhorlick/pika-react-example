# pika-react-example

This is a basic example project using pika, typescript, react and rxjs.

## Development set up

Install packages from npm and run them through pika so they'll run in the browser:
```bash
$ npm install
```

The development server requires the [go](https://golang.org/dl/) language to be installed.

## Running locally

Use the following script to start a development server. This has been configured to serve compiled typescript and the associated sources so they can be debugged in a browser.
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

Then open https://localhost:8443/
